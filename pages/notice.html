				 For me, valorant is a very good game, even if there are quite a few negative points. Since there is a "competition" mode there are therefore ranks, except that it is possible to take an account called "smurf" which means that you play below your rank. There are also players who leave in the middle of the game, or even those who sabotage their team. That's why valorant can infuriate. Currently on my account created during the summer holidays I am at 320 hours of games. On valorant I mainly play Raze who is a duelist his goal is to enter sites and look for duels. I really like this type of agent because the game depends on you during the attack phase.Thanks to valorant I was also able to meet a lot of very nice people with whom I still play. Valorant is above all a game of aim, which I like because it's not all about playing lots of games to improve, you also have to train on other applications in order to obtain a better aim. . It's also a horrible game because it's possible to buy skins on the weapons we have, this allows us to make our weapons look nicer but gives us no additional advantage in the game. So if you like good to have the last very pretty skin pay attention to your credit card, I speak about it as experiment.
